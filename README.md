# Todo

This is a project from The Odin Project JavaScript course to learn Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

The assignment is to build a todo app that lets you create projects and add tasks to them, with title, description, dueDate and priority properties. In this project, i tried to build the app following the Single Responsibility principle as much as possible.

This app is made with HTML, vanilla CSS and vanilla javaScript, with a few node modules and bundled with Webpack.
